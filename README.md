It a simple chess game (with local online support) but with a little change

Main idea: When two same piece (rook, knight, bishop, queen) got captured, king got them move. If the side that captured 4 of the opponent pieces, king will gain one live(move 2 time).

This project in current state is full of AI code and buggy stuff that im not fix and touch anytime soon

Check branch to see process, main doesnt contain anything

Lesson from this project
- unity mirror networking
- AI code is not that good so have to check a f*k ton of stuff before push to production
